# Computer Vision Training Library (WIP)
Train Computer Vision models on your dataset with just a few lines of code. 

##ToDO

1. Website where users can drag and drop model architectures and download a file (JSON) with all the model details that the lib uses to generate a nn.Module model. 
2. Find best LR - check per batch.
3. Make early stopping and scheduler stuff easier to use. 
6. Different model weight inits.
7. Live Camera thing, get frames and display output on frame. 

##Done
5. Seed everything.
4. Make fit, validation and test functions part of a new model class.
